# StaticSystemSkulls
Keeps system difficulty the same throughout the campaign.

# Details
By default at certain points in the campaign, a global difficulty modifier is increased, resulting in a difficulty boost to all systems. This mod removes that difficulty increase; ie. a 2.5 skull system will always be 2.5 skulls.
